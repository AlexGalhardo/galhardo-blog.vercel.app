    <h2 id="infinite-monkey-theorem-and-the-turing-machine">Infinite Monkey Theorem and the Turing Machine</h2>
<p>Imagine a monkey sitting in front of a computer, typing totally random things. Given infinite time, the monkey will type EVERY book written by mankind to date. That&#39;s the Infinite Monkey Theorem, one of the most important things I&#39;ve learned in my life.</p>
<p>There is a very direct and simple to understand summary on wikipedia: <a href="https://pt.wikipedia.org/wiki/Teorema_do_macaco_infinito">https://pt.wikipedia.org/wiki/Teorema_do_macaco_infinito</a></p>
<p>Now imagine that your favorite song has exactly 10 MegaBytes, and knowing that 1 Byte is 8 bits, then:</p>
<p>The song has a total of: 10 MB = 10 . 2^20 . 8 = 83,886,080 bits.</p>
<p>Knowing that a bit can be 1 or 0, we have: 2^83,886,080 (2 raised to 83 million ~) possible possibilities of different sets that these bits can be organized.</p>
<p>To make it explicit to understand: how many different sets can I have with 4 bits?</p>
<p>2^4 = 16 = [
0000,
0001,
0010,
0011,
0100,
0101,
0110,
0111,
1000,
1001,
1010,
1011,
1100,
1101,
1110,
1111
]</p>
<p>Given a computer with infinite processing and memory, simulating the same Monkey strategy above, every time the computer manages to organize a random set of 10MB and giving this output, at some point, this computer will organize the bits in such a way that its 10MB favorite song will be the output of this processing.</p>
<p>This is in a very layman and summarized way, in my words, how the Turing Machine works, created by a British man named Alan Turing in 1937, one of the most important human beings of humanity.</p>
<p>In 1948, the world saw one of the most important scientific articles of all times, entitled &quot;A Mathematical Theory of Communication&quot;, published by Claude Shannon, which, in a super summarized way, says that we can represent, transmit, quantify and store information through boolean logic (true or false, 1 or 0, open closed, etc.)</p>
<p>Alan Turing&#39;s Turing Machine and Shannon&#39;s Theory of Information are to computing what Newton&#39;s Principia Mathematica and Einstein&#39;s General Relativity are to physics. Knowing and understanding these concepts for the first time was one of the best sensations of my life.</p>
<p>Now imagine any movie that will be released 200 years from now, where all the people involved in that movie weren&#39;t born yet. Let&#39;s assume that 200 years from now, this random movie will be exactly 2GB.</p>
<p>Applying the logic above, we will have a total of: 2GB = 2 . 2^30 . 8 = 17,179,869,184 (17 billion ~ bits)
Soon we will have: 2^17,179,869,184 (2 raised to 17~ billion) possible possible sets of bits, which is an infinitely gigantic number, probably bigger than the amount of atoms existing in the universe.</p>
<p>Hypothetically speaking, if the Turing Machine really existed with infinite processing and memory, processing a 2GB set of random bits, at some point the output would be this movie that will be released in 200 years.</p>
<p>Do you understand where I want to go?</p>
<p>It&#39;s as if, if the Turing Machine really existed, it could simulate or predict the past, present and future, just by arranging the 1&#39;s and 0&#39;s in sequence...</p>
